# practice-user-management-operations-Joshua-L

I had to go back and kinda redo the whole thing. While going through the practice before class, I didn't realize you could just select the an individual script to run. So I was writing the script, using 
the select all portion lighting bolt to run the code and then delete after it ran and then write a new script, run and delete and so on. After class today when Carrie showed us how to run indivdual code without deleting,
it made more sense.
